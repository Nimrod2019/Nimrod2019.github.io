This project helps visualize 4 aspects of the naval action game World of Warships.

	1. Total number of PVP battles played by 4 players 
	2. Timeline of battles to date (only last 30 days)
	3. Win/loss ratio
	4. Radar chart exploring the different ways players can sink other ships as well as the max number of kills per type

The context page provides an overview of the game including ship types and the weapons (guns, torpedoes, ramming) that can be utilized to gain victory.
