<font color="#ffffff" size="+1" face="arial">Cruisers generally have decent manuverability and larger caliber guns compared to destoyers that fire slower but do more damage. They are ideal for hunting destroyers and annoying battleships with a constant volume of shellfire.</font><p><br>

<font color="#ffffff" size="+1" face="arial">Slow and as tough as nails, battleships have the armor to withstand shellfire and the punching power to potentially sink cruisers in one salvo. The main bane of battleships are torpedos and arial attack from aircraft carriers. Fight battleships and protect your cruisers.</font><p><br>

<font color="#ffffff" size="+1" face="arial">Aircraft carriers are the most important class in the game since they can provide intelligence and spotting for the team. With a wide array of armament such as bombs, torpedoes, and rockets, aircraft carriers can strike both cruisers and battleships with ease. Be warned however, they quickly fall under fire when spotted.</font><p><br>
<font color="#ffffff" size="+1" face="arial"><b>Game Mechanics</b></font><p>
<font color="#ffffff" size="+1" face="arial">Guns are the main method of dealing damage in World of Warships. Generally the larger your gun caliber, the more potential max damage you can do.</font><p><br>
<font color="#ffffff" size="+1" face="arial">Gun caliber can be as small as the tiny 5 inch guns on destoyers like USS Sherman</font><p><br>

<font color="#ffffff" size="+1" face="arial">Torpedoes are devestating little buggers that can be launched from naealy all destroyers and about half of the cruisers. They can be hard to spot and harder to dodge and have the potential to sink you in one hit!</font><p><br>
